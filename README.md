Block Breaker Game written in Rust.

I made this game to get familliar with Rust.

I followed this tutorial to make the game https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript

I also referenced this block breaker library written in Rust https://github.com/jeffa5/block-breaker

Lastly, I utilized the ggez library as the game engine https://ggez.rs/
